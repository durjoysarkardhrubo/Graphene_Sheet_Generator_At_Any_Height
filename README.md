# Graphene_Sheet_Generator_At_Any_Height

This repository contains a Python script that generates a 2D graphene sheet based on user-defined unit cell parameters and supercell dimensions. Users can specify the height along the z-axis. The generated atomic positions are saved in a text file, making it suitable for simulations and computational studies.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python3 or higher installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Graphene_Sheet_Generator_At_Any_Height.git
   cd Graphene_Sheet_Generator_At_Any_Height

**2. Run the Script**
```bash
 python3 generate_graphene.py

**3.Input Parameters**
```bash
Enter the size of the supercell in the x direction: 5
```bash
Enter the size of the supercell in the y direction: 5
```bash
Enter the z-height for the graphene sheet: 10.0
```bash
Graphene supercell with size 5x5x1 at z-height 10.0 has been generated and saved to 'graphene_supercell.txt'.
