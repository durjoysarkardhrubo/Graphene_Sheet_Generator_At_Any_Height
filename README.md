# Graphene_Sheet_Generator_At_Any_Height
This repository contains a Python script that generates a 2D graphene sheet based on user-defined unit cell parameters and supercell dimensions. Users can specify the height along the z-axis. The atomic positions are saved in a text file, ideal for simulations and computational studies.
